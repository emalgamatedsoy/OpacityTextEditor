# OpacityTextEditor

This is a small text editor that I have created in order to allow for the editing window to become opaque, such that someone who is taking
<br>
notes will be able to write while looking through the editor.
<br>
<br>
This program is designed for someone who is running a windows computer and needs to observe documents while taking notes at the same time.
<br>
<br>
Currently associated with this project, there needs to be a few changes..
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The text editor can only handle <b>2^32 characters</b> before an overflow occurs.
<br>
For the purpose of writing this program, I wouldn't expect someone to load a text file with more than 2.4 billion characters.
<br>
<br>
Also, there is no documentation on this program aside from this markdown file.
<br>
<br>
any contribution would be appreciated by anyone who wishes to do so.
<br>
This is freeware, and not intended to be sold, nor re-sold.
